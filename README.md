# Maze Traversal Using DFS

**Author:** Ali Zeyad Ali Altiti

## Description
This project solves and optimizes maze paths using Depth-First Search (DFS).  
The program converts the last `k` visited empty cells into walls and prints the final maze configuration.

## Files
- `Maze.py` – Python script to solve the maze using DFS.

## Libraries Used
- Python 3
- No external libraries required

## Tasks Performed
- Read maze dimensions and number of cells to convert
- Represent maze as a 2D list
- Perform DFS to visit all connected empty cells
- Convert the last `k` visited cells into walls
- Print the modified maze

## How to Run
1. Make sure Python 3 is installed.
2. Run the script in the terminal:
```bash
python Maze.py
